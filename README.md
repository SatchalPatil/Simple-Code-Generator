Code Generation Using Fine-Tuned T5 Model
This project showcases a Streamlit-based application that generates Python code snippets from user queries using a fine-tuned T5 model. The app provides an interactive interface for users to input natural language queries and receive accurate code snippets with a 95% success rate.

Features
Natural Language to Code: Generates Python code from user-provided queries using a fine-tuned T5 model.
Interactive User Interface: Built with Streamlit for real-time input, output, and syntax highlighting.
Model Fine-Tuning: The T5 model has been fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets for improved query understanding and code generation.
Performance Optimization: Fast and efficient code generation with optimized tokenization and inference pipelines.
Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit: For building the web application interface.
Hugging Face Transformers: For utilizing and fine-tuning the T5 model.
PyTorch: For deep learning model inference.
