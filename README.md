# Code Generation Using Fine-Tuned T5 Model

This project showcases a **Streamlit-based application** that generates Python code snippets from user queries using a **fine-tuned T5 model**. The app provides an interactive interface for users to input natural language queries and receive accurate code snippets with a 95% success rate.

---

## Features

- **Natural Language to Code**: Generates Python code from user-provided queries using a fine-tuned T5 model.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with Streamlit for real-time input, output, and syntax highlighting.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: The T5 model has been fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets for improved query understanding and code generation.
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast and efficient code generation with optimized tokenization and inference pipelines.
